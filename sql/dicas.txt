tar -xvf ./matrix.tar

triggers and stored procedures you only need to add the ï¿½routines command line parameter:

mysqldump <other mysqldump options> --routines outputfile.sql

Lets assume we want to backup ONLY the stored procedures and triggers and not the mysql tables and data (this can be useful to import these in another db/server that has already the data but not the stored procedures and/or triggers), then we should run something like:

mysqldump --routines --no-create-info --no-data --no-create-db --skip-opt <database> > outputfile.sql

and this will save only the procedures/functions/triggers of the . If you need to import them to another db/server you will have to run something like:

mysql <database> < outputfile.sql
